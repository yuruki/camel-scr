Camel runner for SCR (OSGi)

Running Camel in an SCR bundle is a great alternative for the more common methods (Spring DM and Blueprint). Using Camel runner for SCR your bundle can remain completely in Java world; there is no need to create or modify any XML or properties files. This offers us full control over everything and also means that your IDE knows exactly what is going on in your project.

Usage and camel-archetype-scr coming soon...
